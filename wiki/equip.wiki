{{{function [obj]=equip(iref,type)}}}

= Input(s) =

|| variable || description || type ||
|| iref		|| item/spell ID (as in idb) for an item to equip || string or int ||

= Description =

The equip() function is the intermediary between the item database and the
equipped gear set.  Proper use would be something like:

{{{egs.mainhand=equip('Last Laugh');}}}

or

{{{egs.mainhand=equip(40402,'iid');}}}

Which would equip Last Laugh in the mainhand slot.

equip() first checks for the type of input argument. If the input is numeric,
it then checks for 'iid'/'sid' input types, then loads iid(iref) or sid(iref).
For a text input, it searches through idb until it finds the item number with
a name string that matches iref, and then returns the stats.

*IMPORTANT* : it is much faster to reference an item by inum (item_id, as parsed by armory) than by its name.

= Caveats =
idb database must be loaded prior to use of this function.
