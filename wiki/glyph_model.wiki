= Description =

This file handles and updates a player's glyphs.  The 'glyph' structure
contains both shorthand and long forms of the glyph configuration.

The short form is a 1x3 array of integers.  Each integer
represents a given major glyph.  Glyph ID numbers are given in the table below.
A zero represents an empty glyph slot.  Note that minors are ignored.

So for exammple, having no glyphs equipped would give a [0 0 0] matrix.
Adding glyph of Alabaster Shield in the first Major slot would give a short
form of [1 0 0]

The long form is similar to the old system, where each glyph is given by
name and represented as a boolean value.
