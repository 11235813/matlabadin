  == Installation/Running ==
  * I'm getting X errors while running under MATLAB or compiling the C# code
    * See if your issue has been reported in [http://code.google.com/p/matlabadin/issues/list Issues]. If not, collect the error message, MATLAB version number, C# compiler version, source code revision number and create a defect issue. We'll address it as best as we can. Note that the better your issue report is, the more likely it is to get fixed. Issues like 'UR code sux' will be deleted since they aren't helpful. 
  * I'm getting X errors while running under Octave, Scilab or Freemat
    * Because the developers work primarily in MATLAB, we cannot guarantee things will work perfectly in the alternative programs. However, feel free to report an issue as noted above and we'll see what we can do!
