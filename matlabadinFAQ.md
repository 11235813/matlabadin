# Frequently Asked Questions #

> ## Installation/Running ##
  * I'm getting X errors while running under MATLAB or compiling the C# code
    * See if your issue has been reported in [Issues](http://code.google.com/p/matlabadin/issues/list). If not, collect the error message, MATLAB version number, C# compiler version, source code revision number and create a defect issue. We'll address it as best as we can. Note that the better your issue report is, the more likely it is to get fixed. Issues like 'UR code sux' will be deleted since they aren't helpful.
  * I'm getting X errors while running under Octave, Scilab or Freemat
    * Because the developers work primarily in MATLAB, we cannot guarantee things will work perfectly in the alternative programs. However, feel free to report an issue as noted above and we'll see what we can do!

> ## Code-related ##
  * I think I found an mistake in the MATLAB/C# code!
    * Awesome! Make a note of the mistake, file, revision number and file a defect [issue](http://code.google.com/p/matlabadin/issues/list). Also perhaps consider joining us by contacting one of the project owners in trying to make this code better!
  * I think I know an easier/faster/better way to do X, or would like to request a new feature.
    * Even better! Write up a description of your proposed change, file, revision number and file an enhancement [issue](http://code.google.com/p/matlabadin/issues/list). Also perhaps consider joining us by contacting one of the project owners in trying to make this code better!
